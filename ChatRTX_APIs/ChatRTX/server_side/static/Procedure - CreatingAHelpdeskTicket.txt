Helpdesk Ticket Guidelines

You can create a ticket from the Countyline Website or emailing ISD Helpdesk

Guideline: A detailed and descriptive ticket will significantly help the resolution time. A poorly or incorrectly written ticket could result in not only longer resolution time but being close without resolution. 

INFORMATION TO INCLUDE ON A HELP TICKET:

Required:
User’s name and Employee ID
FAS Code of user
Bluetag number(s)
Contact Information of user and requester
Issue/request with details (Name of application/website, error message, etc)
*Please avoid broad terms like “not working” or “computer issue/help” and be as descriptive as possible.*

	Optional:
Screenshots
Scope and impact (How many users are affected? How much is this impacting workflow?)
When did issue start?
What has the user tried? Have they restarted their computer?
Is the issue happening for same user on another computer?
Is the issue happening to other users on same computer?
Any significant changes to your computer/account recently?
