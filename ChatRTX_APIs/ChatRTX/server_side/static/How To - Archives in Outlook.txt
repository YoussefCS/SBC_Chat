Creating Archives
Open up Outlook 2016.  In the top-left select “File”. Click on “Account Settings” drop down and select “Account Settings…”.



Select “Data Files” tab in the E-mail accounts settings. Then select “Add..”


You will then type in a name for the archive and navigate to where you would like to store it. You should store this on your N:\ drive.



Auto-Archiving

Setting up auto-archives will automatically archive your emails based off time. To setup, navigate in Outlook by clicking “File” on the top-left of outlook. The click “Options” and select the “Advanced” tab on the left. Within the Advanced options, you will look and click on “AutoArchive Settings…”
 

You will then check the boxes accordingly. In the example above, I have stated that I would like Outlook to archive for me every two weeks. Every two weeks, Outlook will prompt me to archive. It will then look for any emails that are older than 6 months. It will then take any 6 month old emails and move them into my pre-existing archive2.pst that is stored on my N drive. Once you have defined your own parameters, you must click “Apply these settings to all folders now” and then hit “OK”.

You can also define AutoArchive settings based off folder, by right-clicking on the folder and choose Properties and then got to the AutoArchive tab.
