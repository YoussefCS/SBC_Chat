Telework Agreement 
Telework 
Teleworking is an alternative work arrangement available to qualifying County employees to work from a remote 
workplace, such as one’s home or satellite office, rather than commuting to a designated worksite.  Management 
will establish a work arrangement with their qualifying employees.  The arrangement is not permanent and may 
be terminated for any reason.  
Requirements 
Employees who participate in a telework arrangement must complete this Telework Agreement. Departments 
may have additional requirements. Supervisors should also ensure the Employee has access to County and 
Department Telework Policies and Standard Practices as indicated on page 2 of the Telework Authorization.  
Supervisors should complete the following forms within this agreement and route for signatures and distribution: 
 
Telework Authorization (page 1-2) 
 
Telework Self-Certification Checklist (page 3) 
 
Telework Equipment Loan (page 4) 
Training 
Employees who elect a telework arrangement must complete required online training courses through the 
Performance, Education & Resource Centers (PERC) Learning Center at https://perclms.sbcounty.gov/learn. 
Distribution 
The executed Telework Agreement should remain on file with the department, with copies provided to the 
employee and to hrcommuterservices@sbcounty.gov for County records. Electronic signatures are acceptable 
and encouraged. 
Questions? Please contact HR-Commuter Services or your Department Human Resources Officer.

E. Ending Participation. Telework is a voluntary arrangement that can be terminated at any time. 
(a) Employee may request to terminate participation and Departments will make reasonable 
arrangements to have a work station at a worksite made available within a reasonable period of 
time.    
(b) Management may terminate an employee’s telework participation at any time, including, but not 
limited to the reasons below: 
(i) For changed circumstances or operation needs; advanced written notice to employees is 
encouraged.  
(ii) Telework arrangements may be terminated immediately for cause, including performance-
based reasons, with no advanced written notice provided. 
F. Technical Difficulties. 
1. Employees are responsible for immediately reporting to their supervisor any technical issues they may 
be experiencing that are preventing them from teleworking.  
2. County-owned or provided equipment, software or services:  
(a) The supervisor will determine if equipment down time warrants the teleworker to report to the 
office. 
(b) The County will provide for repairs and/or support for County-owned equipment and software, 
but only by phone or at a County office or vendor location.  In-home support will not be provided.
