practices, under the following terms and conditions:

I understand protection software requires a Personal Identification Number (PIN) code and an auto-lock setting that have been
installed by Business and Technology Solutions and I will not modify, tamper with, or remove the security safeguards.
2.
I will immediately report to the department head/designee a lost, stolen, tampered, damaged or unauthorized access of the mobile
device. If the lost device is found, I will notify the department head/designee within 24-hours or next business day.

I will file a report with law enforcement if the mobile device is stolen and list the County of San Bernardino as a victim. I will follow-
up with completing a DPW Incident Report Form.
5.

credit card numbers, health information etc.)  to any third-party applications or internet storage.
7.
I acknowledge the county-owned mobile device will be set for remote wipe capability, a feature that will permanently erase stored
data at the department’s discretion or if the device is lost, stolen, damaged or tampered with and the county is not liable for any
personal information stored on the device.

upon separation from the department, or if the need for a mobile device no longer exists. Business and Technology Solutions will
delete my access to any and all applicable county servers, county email and data.
